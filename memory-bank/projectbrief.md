# Project Brief

## Core Description
This project is about implementing monads in Rust.

## Core Requirements
- Implement common monadic structures.
- Ensure the implementations are idiomatic Rust.
- Provide examples or tests for the implemented monads.

## Main Goals
- To explore and understand monads from a practical implementation perspective.
- To create a reusable library of monadic structures in Rust.
- To learn more about functional programming concepts in Rust.
