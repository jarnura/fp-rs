# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
This project exists to provide a practical implementation of monadic structures within the Rust programming language. It aims to serve as both a learning resource for understanding monads and a functional library component for Rust developers.

## Problems It Solves
- **Lack of accessible monad implementations:** While Rust has features that can be used to emulate monadic patterns (like `Option` and `Result`), a dedicated library focusing on a broader range of monads can be beneficial.
- **Bridging functional programming concepts:** Helps Rust developers, who may come from various programming paradigms, to understand and utilize functional programming concepts like monads more effectively.
- **Encapsulating complex patterns:** Monads provide a way to abstract and manage common computational patterns such as handling optional values, errors, state, asynchronous operations, etc., in a composable manner.

## How It Should Work
- The library should define generic traits for different monadic structures (e.g., `Functor`, `Applicative`, `Monad`).
- Concrete types should implement these traits for common monads (e.g., `Option`, `Result`, `Vec`, potentially custom ones like `State`, `IO`).
- The implementations should be efficient and leverage Rust's type system and ownership model.
- Clear examples and documentation should guide users on how to use the implemented monads.

## User Experience Goals
- **Clarity:** The purpose and usage of each monad should be clear and well-documented.
- **Ease of Use:** Developers should find it straightforward to integrate and use these monadic structures in their Rust projects.
- **Idiomatic Rust:** The library should feel natural to Rust developers, adhering to common Rust conventions and best practices.
- **Educational Value:** The codebase and documentation should serve as a good learning resource for those new to monads or functional programming in Rust.
