# Project Progress

## What Works
- **Memory Bank Foundation:** Core documents created.
- **Project Directory Structure:** Basic structure in place.
- **Initial Codebase Review Completed:** All files in `src/` reviewed.
- **Phase 1 Refinements Implemented:** Isolated `MyApply`, renamed `Functor::map`, relaxed `'static` bound in `Functor::map`.
- **Functor Law Tests (for `Option<A>`):** Added Identity and Composition law tests.
- **Applicative Law Tests (for `Option<A>`):** Added Identity, Homomorphism, Interchange, and Map law tests.
- **Monad Law Tests (for `Option<A>`):** Added Left Identity, Right Identity, and Associativity law tests.
- **Successful Test Run (Phase 1):** `cargo test` passed, verifying Phase 1 refinements and initial law tests for `Option<A>` (36 tests passed).
- **Functor Law Tests (for `Result<T, E>`):** Added Identity and Composition law tests.
- **Applicative Law Tests (for `Result<T, E>`):** Added Identity, Homomorphism, Interchange, and Map law tests.
- **Monad Law Tests (for `Result<T, E>`):** Added Left Identity, Right Identity, and Associativity law tests.
- **Successful Test Run (Phase 2):** `cargo test` passed, verifying Phase 2 implementations and law tests for `Result<T, E>` (56 tests passed).
- **Test Refactoring:** Moved all inline test modules (`mod tests { ... }`) from `src/` files to the standard `tests/` directory structure for integration tests. Verified with `cargo test` (56 tests + 3 doc tests passed).

## What's Left to Build / Planned (Key Priorities)
- **Implement Traits for `Vec<T>`:** Systematically add implementations for `Vec<T>` for `Functor`, `Apply`, `Applicative`, `Bind` (Monad), along with their corresponding law tests.
- **Profunctor & Optics:** Review, refine, test (laws), and document `Profunctor`, `Strong`, `Choice` traits and the optics system. Add law tests.
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive `rustdoc` for all public items, examples.
- **Benchmarking:** Set up and use `criterion.rs`.
- **Address Warnings:** Clean up dead code, unused imports/variables, and E0210 warnings.
- **`src/main.rs`:** Define purpose (e.g., examples, CLI).

## Current Status
- **Phase:** Phase 2 (`Result<T, E>` implementations and tests) completed and verified. Planning Phase 3 (`Vec<T>`).
- **Focus:** Implementing traits and law tests for `Vec<T>`.

## Known Issues
- Law tests are missing for `Vec<T>`.
- Law tests are missing for Profunctor, Strong, Choice.
- Optics system is advanced and requires dedicated review and testing.
- `src/main.rs` is currently a placeholder.
- Remaining warnings (dead code, E0210, unused imports/variables) need eventual attention.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **[YYYY-MM-DD]:** Initial decision to create a comprehensive Memory Bank.
- **[Date of Review]:** Completed initial review of all files in `src/`.
- **[Date of Refinement]:** Completed Phase 1 refinements (Isolate `MyApply`, rename `map`, relax `'static` bound).
- **[Date of Law Tests]:** Added Functor, Applicative, and Monad law tests for `Option<A>`.
- **[07/05/2025]:** Switched project from nightly to stable Rust toolchain, refactoring code to remove nightly dependencies.
- **[07/05/2025]:** Added public re-exports to `src/lib.rs` for core traits to improve API ergonomics.
- **[08/05/2025]:** Completed Phase 2: Implemented Functor, Apply, Applicative, Bind/Monad traits and law tests for `Result<T, E>`. Resolved `Clone` issues by reverting `CFn` to use `Box` and adjusting tests.
- **[08/05/2025]:** Refactored test organization by moving inline test modules from `src/` to the `tests/` directory, following standard Rust integration test patterns.
- (This section will track significant decisions and changes in direction as the project progresses.)
