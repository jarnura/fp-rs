# Project Progress

## What Works
- **Core Monadic Implementations:**
    - `Option<A>`: Functor, Apply, Applicative, Monad traits and laws implemented and tested.
    - `Result<T, E>`: Functor, Apply, Applicative, Monad traits and laws implemented and tested.
    - `Vec<T>`: Functor, Apply, Applicative, Monad traits and laws implemented and tested.
- **Profunctor Implementation:**
    - `Profunctor`, `Strong`, `Choice` traits and laws implemented and tested for `CFn`.
- **Codebase Health:**
    - All (83 unit + 3 doc) tests passing.
    - Code formatted with `cargo fmt`.
    - Linted with `cargo clippy` (no warnings beyond intentionally suppressed ones).
    - All compiler warnings addressed.
- **Memory Bank:**
    - Core documents established.
    - Archive for historical project data created: [Project History](./archive/project_history_pre_aug_2025.md).
- For detailed history of completed work, see the [Project History](./archive/project_history_pre_aug_2025.md).

## What's Left to Build / Planned (Key Priorities)
- **Phase 3, Step 3: Documentation:** Comprehensive `rustdoc` for all public items, examples. Update `README.md` (Current).
- **Benchmarking:** Set up and use `criterion.rs` (lower priority).
- **`src/main.rs`:** Define purpose (e.g., examples, CLI) (lower priority).
- **`Cargo.toml` Metadata:** Update author and URL information (lower priority).
- **Revisit `BitOr` for `BindType`:** Consider alternative designs if operator syntax is desired (lower priority).


## Current Status
- **Phase:** Phase 3, Step 3 (Documentation).
- **Focus:** Writing `rustdoc` comments and updating `README.md`.
- **Overall Test Status:** 83 unit tests + 3 doc tests passing. Code is clean and formatted.

## Known Issues
- `src/main.rs` is currently a placeholder.
- Benchmarking not yet implemented.
- Placeholder metadata (author, URLs) in `Cargo.toml`.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Historical project decisions and their evolution are documented in the [Project History](./archive/project_history_pre_aug_2025.md).
- Current decision-making focuses on effective documentation strategies and API clarity.
