# Project Progress

## What Works
- **Memory Bank Foundation:** Core documents created.
- **Project Directory Structure:** Basic structure in place.
- **Initial Codebase Review Completed:** All files in `src/` reviewed.
- **Phase 1 Refinements Implemented:** Isolated `MyApply`, renamed `Functor::map`, relaxed `'static` bound in `Functor::map`.
- **Functor Law Tests (for `Option<A>`):** Added Identity and Composition law tests.
- **Applicative Law Tests (for `Option<A>`):** Added Identity, Homomorphism, Interchange, and Map law tests.
- **Monad Law Tests (for `Option<A>`):** Added Left Identity, Right Identity, and Associativity law tests.
- **Successful Test Run (Phase 1):** `cargo test` passed, verifying Phase 1 refinements and initial law tests for `Option<A>` (36 tests passed).
- **Functor Law Tests (for `Result<T, E>`):** Added Identity and Composition law tests.
- **Applicative Law Tests (for `Result<T, E>`):** Added Identity, Homomorphism, Interchange, and Map law tests.
- **Monad Law Tests (for `Result<T, E>`):** Added Left Identity, Right Identity, and Associativity law tests.
- **Successful Test Run (Phase 2):** `cargo test` passed, verifying Phase 2 implementations and law tests for `Result<T, E>` (56 tests passed at that time).
- **Test Refactoring:** Moved all inline test modules (`mod tests { ... }`) from `src/` files to the standard `tests/` directory structure for integration tests. Verified with `cargo test` (56 tests + 3 doc tests passed at that time).
- **Phase 3, Step 1 (Vec<T> Implementation & Tests) Completed:**
    - Implemented `Functor` for `Vec<T>` and added Functor law tests.
    - Implemented `Apply` for `Vec<T>` and added Apply law tests.
    - Implemented `Applicative` for `Vec<T>` and added Applicative law tests.
    - Implemented `Bind` (and `Monad`) for `Vec<T>` and added Monad law tests.
    - All `Vec<T>` tests passing.
- **Phase 3, Step 2 (Profunctor & Optics Review and Testing) Completed:**
    - Reviewed `src/profunctor.rs` including `lens_` and `lens`.
    - Fixed failing `Strong` and `Choice` law tests in `tests/profunctor.rs`.
    - Commented out unused code (`dimap_`, `Optic_`, `Lens_`) in `src/profunctor.rs`.
    - Added `strong_associativity_law` test.
    - All Profunctor, Strong, and Choice law tests passing.
    - `cargo test` confirms 83 unit tests + 3 doc tests passing.
- **Phase 3, Step 4 (Final Review & Cleanup) Completed:**
    - Codebase formatted (`cargo fmt`).
    - Codebase linted (`cargo clippy`), no issues found.
    - All compiler warnings addressed (dead code, unused items, E0210). E0210 resolved by removing `BitOr` impl. Necessary trait imports in tests retained but warnings suppressed.
    - `Cargo.toml` reviewed, "no-std" category removed.
    - `cargo test` confirms 83 unit tests + 3 doc tests passing without warnings.

## What's Left to Build / Planned (Key Priorities)
- **Phase 3, Step 3: Documentation:** Comprehensive `rustdoc` for all public items, examples. Update `README.md` (Current).
- **Benchmarking:** Set up and use `criterion.rs` (lower priority).
- **`src/main.rs`:** Define purpose (e.g., examples, CLI) (lower priority).
- **`Cargo.toml` Metadata:** Update author and URL information (lower priority).
- **Revisit `BitOr` for `BindType`:** Consider alternative designs if operator syntax is desired (lower priority).


## Current Status
- **Phase:** Phase 3, Step 3 (Documentation).
- **Focus:** Writing `rustdoc` comments and updating `README.md`.
- **Overall Test Status:** 83 unit tests + 3 doc tests passing. Code is clean and formatted.

## Known Issues
- `src/main.rs` is currently a placeholder.
- Benchmarking not yet implemented.
- Placeholder metadata (author, URLs) in `Cargo.toml`.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **[YYYY-MM-DD]:** Initial decision to create a comprehensive Memory Bank.
- **[Date of Review]:** Completed initial review of all files in `src/`.
- **[Date of Refinement]:** Completed Phase 1 refinements (Isolate `MyApply`, rename `map`, relax `'static` bound).
- **[Date of Law Tests]:** Added Functor, Applicative, and Monad law tests for `Option<A>`.
- **[07/05/2025]:** Switched project from nightly to stable Rust toolchain, refactoring code to remove nightly dependencies.
- **[07/05/2025]:** Added public re-exports to `src/lib.rs` for core traits to improve API ergonomics.
- **[08/05/2025]:** Completed Phase 2: Implemented Functor, Apply, Applicative, Bind/Monad traits and law tests for `Result<T, E>`. Resolved `Clone` issues by reverting `CFn` to use `Box` and adjusting tests.
- **[08/05/2025]:** Refactored test organization by moving inline test modules from `src/` to the `tests/` directory, following standard Rust integration test patterns.
- **[Current Date - Set by User]:** Completed Phase 3, Step 1 (`Vec<T>` implementations and tests).
- **[08/05/2025]:** Completed Phase 3, Step 2 (Profunctor & Optics review and testing):
    - Fixed `Strong` and `Choice` law tests.
    - Reviewed `lens_`, `lens`.
    - Commented out unused code in `src/profunctor.rs`.
    - Added `strong_associativity_law`.
- **[08/05/2025]:** Completed Phase 3, Step 4 (Final Review & Cleanup). Resolved all compiler warnings, including E0210 by removing `BitOr` impl. Suppressed misleading `unused_imports` warnings in tests. Ran `fmt` and `clippy`.
