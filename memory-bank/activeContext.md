# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- **Phase 3, Step 3: Comprehensive Documentation.** Focus on writing `rustdoc` comments and updating `README.md`.

## Recent Changes
- **Phase 3, Step 4 (Final Review & Cleanup) Completed:**
    - Codebase formatted, linted, and all compiler/clippy warnings addressed.
    - E0210 (orphan rule) for `BitOr` on `BindType` resolved by removing the implementation.
    - `cargo test` confirms 83 unit tests + 3 doc tests passing without warnings.
- For a detailed history of previous changes and completed phases, see [Project History](./archive/project_history_pre_aug_2025.md).


## Next Steps
- **Phase 3, Step 3: Comprehensive Documentation.** This includes:
    - Writing `rustdoc` comments for all public items in the library.
    - Updating `README.md` with project status, usage examples, and API overview.
- **Post-Phase 3 Considerations (Lower Priority):**
    - **Benchmarking:** Set up and use `criterion.rs`.
    - **`src/main.rs`:** Define purpose (e.g., examples, CLI).
    - **`Cargo.toml` Metadata:** Update author and URL information when available.
    - **Revisit `BitOr` for `BindType`:** Consider alternative designs if the operator syntax is desired.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **`CFn` Clonability:** Decided against making `CFn` (holding `Box<dyn Fn>`) easily `Clone` due to complexity. Tests requiring multiple uses of the same function now recreate the `CFn` instance. This might need revisiting if it becomes a major ergonomic issue.
- **Test Module Organization:** Integration tests are now located in the top-level `tests/` directory, mirroring the module structure of `src/`. Law tests remain organized in submodules within these test files.
- **Warnings:** All compiler and clippy warnings addressed in Phase 3, Step 4. Some potentially incorrect `unused_imports` warnings for necessary trait imports (like `Functor`) in test files were suppressed using `#[allow(unused_imports)]`.
- **E0210 / Orphan Rule:** The `impl BitOr for BindType` in `src/function.rs` violated the orphan rule and caused an E0210 warning (future error). Decided to remove the implementation for now to resolve the warning. Direct `bind` calls must be used instead.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Documentation First:** Keeping Memory Bank updated.
- **Systematic Refinement & Testing:** Core `Option<T>` and `Result<T, E>` implementations verified with law tests.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Key learnings from completed development phases have been archived. See [Project History](./archive/project_history_pre_aug_2025.md) for details.
- Current focus is on applying best practices for documentation and ensuring the library is easy to understand and use.
