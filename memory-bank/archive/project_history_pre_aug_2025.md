# Project History (Prior to August 2025 - Documentation Focus)

This document archives significant milestones, completed work, and decisions made prior to the current focus on comprehensive documentation (Phase 3, Step 3).

## Completed Phases and Key Milestones

### Phase 1: Foundations & Option<A>
- Completed initial setup of Memory Bank core documents & code review.
- Implemented Phase 1 Refinements: Isolated `MyApply`, renamed `Functor::map`, relaxed `'static` bound in `Functor::map`.
- Added Functor Law Tests (for `Option<A>`): Identity and Composition.
- Added Applicative Law Tests (for `Option<A>`): Identity, Homomorphism, Interchange, and Map.
- Added Monad Law Tests (for `Option<A>`): Left Identity, Right Identity, and Associativity.
- `cargo test` passed, verifying Phase 1 refinements and initial law tests for `Option<A>` (36 tests passed).

### Toolchain and API Ergonomics
- Switched project from nightly to stable Rust toolchain.
- Added public re-exports for core traits to `src/lib.rs`.

### Phase 2: Result<T, E>
- Implemented `Functor` for `Result<T, E>` and added Functor law tests.
- Implemented `Apply` for `Result<T, E>`.
- Implemented `Applicative` for `Result<T, E>` and added Applicative law tests.
- Implemented `Bind` (and `Monad`) for `Result<T, E>` and added Monad law tests.
- Resolved compilation issues related to `Clone` bounds by reverting `CFn` to use `Box` and adjusting tests to recreate `CFn` instances.
- `cargo test` passed, verifying Phase 2 implementations and law tests for `Result<T, E>` (56 tests passed at that time).

### Test Infrastructure Refactoring
- Refactored Tests: Moved all `#[cfg(test)] mod tests { ... }` blocks from `src/` files (`functor.rs`, `apply.rs`, `applicative.rs`, `monad.rs`, `profunctor.rs`) into separate files within a new top-level `tests/` directory. Adjusted `use` statements accordingly. Verified with `cargo test` (56 tests + 3 doc tests passed at that time).

### Phase 3, Step 1: Vec<T> Implementation & Tests
- Implemented `Functor` for `Vec<T>` and added Functor law tests.
- Implemented `Apply` for `Vec<T>` and added Apply law tests.
- Implemented `Applicative` for `Vec<T>` and added Applicative law tests.
- Implemented `Bind` (and `Monad`) for `Vec<T>` and added Monad law tests.
- Verified changes with `cargo test`.

### Phase 3, Step 2: Profunctor & Optics Review and Testing
- Reviewed `src/profunctor.rs`.
- Fixed failing `Strong` and `Choice` law tests in `tests/profunctor.rs` by correcting assertion values.
- All Profunctor, Strong, and Choice law tests are now passing.
- Reviewed `lens_` and `lens` implementations in `src/profunctor.rs`.
- Commented out unused code: `dimap_` method in `Profunctor` trait and its implementations, and `Optic_`, `Lens_` structs in `src/profunctor.rs`.
- Added a new `strong_associativity_law` test to `tests/profunctor.rs`, which is passing.
- Verified all changes with `cargo test` (83 unit tests + 3 doc tests passed).

### Phase 3, Step 4: Final Review & Cleanup
- Ran `cargo check` and `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`.
- Resolved E0210 warnings in `src/function.rs` by removing the problematic `impl BitOr for BindType`.
- Silenced dead code warning for `Monad` trait in `src/monad.rs` using `#[allow(dead_code)]`.
- Removed dead code (`identity` function) in `tests/profunctor.rs`.
- Fixed/suppressed all `unused_imports` and `unused_variables` warnings across test files. Necessary `Functor` imports were kept but warnings suppressed with `#[allow(unused_imports)]`.
- Ran `cargo fmt` to format the codebase.
- Reviewed `Cargo.toml`, removed inaccurate "no-std" category. Metadata TODOs remain.
- Verified all changes with `cargo test` (83 unit tests + 3 doc tests passed without warnings).
