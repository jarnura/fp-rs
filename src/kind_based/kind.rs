//! # Kind (Higher-Kinded Type) Infrastructure
//!
//! This module provides the core traits and marker types for simulating
//! Higher-Kinded Types (more generically, "Kinds") in Rust. This allows for
//! abstracting over type constructors like `Option`, `Vec`, `Result<_, E>`, etc.,
//! which is fundamental for defining generic functional programming traits like
//! `Functor`, `Applicative`, and `Monad` in the `monadify` library,
//! enabling them to operate over these different type constructors.
//!
//! The primary mechanism used is a combination of:
//! 1.  A central `Kind` trait with a Generic Associated Type (GAT) `Of<Arg>`.
//! 2.  Marker structs (e.g., `OptionKind`) that implement `Kind` and specify
//!     what `Of<Arg>` resolves to for their respective type constructor.
//!
//! This setup enables traits to be generic over the *marker type*, and through
//! the marker's `Of<Arg>` GAT, they can refer to the concrete type
//! (e.g., `Option<String>`, `Vec<i32>`).

/// This trait is the cornerstone of simulating Higher-Kinded Types. It allows
/// abstracting over type constructors that take one type argument, such as
/// `Option<_>`, `Vec<_>`, or `Result<_, E>` (where `E` is fixed).
///
/// Implementors of this trait are typically lightweight "marker" structs
/// (e.g., [`OptionKind`], [`VecKind`]) that don't hold data themselves
/// but serve to identify the type constructor they represent.

    /// to a type argument `Arg`.

    /// - If `Self` is [`OptionKind`], then `Self::Of<Arg>` is `Option<Arg>`.
    /// - If `Self` is [`VecKind`], then `Self::Of<Arg>` is `Vec<Arg>`.
